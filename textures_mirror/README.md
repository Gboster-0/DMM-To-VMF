# textures: their state, how to install them and why i hate them

## Their state
So funky thing, there is no good way to automatically make textures.
So all of them are made by-hand.
Any mistakes should be reported.

Except that, there's not much to say here, the folder contains the VMT's(Valve Material Textures) and VTF's(Valve Material Files) required for this map to properly show you all of its turfs, objects will have proper textures regardless

## How to install them
1. Search up garry's mod in your steam library, right-click into "Manage >> Browse local files"
2. Now you should be at the 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod' directory, go into '.\garrysmod\materials'
3. Then copy-paste the "ss13" folder inside, now you have all the textures you need. (remember to delete them later when you get bored of the novelty)

## How to make them
Best to search up a youtube video, i learned a long time ago so don't remember much. You do need VFTedit tho.
Remember to turn on the "Point Sample" flag, else your textures will be blurry. This was a pain to find.
